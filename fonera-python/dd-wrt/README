This is an old beta release of DD-WRT (DD-WRT v24 Beta (08/03/07) std - build 7603).

It may be downloaded from:

IF YOU ARE TRYING TO RUN PYTHON ON A DD-WRT FONERA, USE THIS FIRMWARE.

Newer firmwares take up too much space, leaving insufficient room on the JFFS2 partition for Python. Other
v24 betas introduce odd errors that prevent Python from running.  I'm sorry, but you're stuck.  If you need newer functionality, you may want to consider the OpenWRT project.
